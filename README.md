#### Factifai Agent

A CLI-first automation tool that allows you to write browser tests in plain English. It translates natural language instructions into precise browser actions using LLMs, executes them through a structured LangGraph workflow, and provides rich terminal visualization of test progress. The agent supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock), cross-browser testing, and seamless CI/CD integration, making automated testing more accessible to team members without specialized testing expertise.

üìö **[View Full Documentation](./packages/factifai-agent/README.md)** for detailed usage instructions, configuration options, and best practices.

#### Playwright Core

A specialized wrapper around Playwright designed specifically for LLMs to control web browsers through a coordinate-based interaction system. Unlike traditional browser automation that relies on complex DOM selectors, this package enables AI models to work with visual coordinates, automatically identifying interactive elements and providing enhanced debugging capabilities. It offers features like session management, automatic element detection, visual element highlighting, and a simplified API that abstracts away Playwright complexity.

üìö **[View Full Documentation](./packages/playwright-core/README.md)** for detailed API reference, integration options, and advanced usage examples.

#### Factif-AI (Web)

The web-based counterpart to Factifai Agent that runs entirely in the browser. It provides the same AI-powered testing capabilities but with a graphical interface, making it accessible without CLI installation. Perfect for teams looking for a quick testing option or those who prefer a visual interface for test creation and execution.

üìö **[View on GitHub](https://github.com/presidio-oss/factif-ai)** for more information and to try it online.

### What's Next?

- **factifai-quest**: A CLI tool that intelligently crawls websites and explores them autonomously, navigating through links and pages to build a comprehensive map of the site. It captures screenshots of each discovered page and leverages LLMs to generate detailed documentation, providing valuable insights for test planning and coverage analysis.

- **factifai-test-curator**: A web-based interface that combines the capabilities of factifai-agent and factifai-quest to create a complete test management solution. It offers targeted website exploration, visual test case editing with before/after screenshots, and an interactive test creation environment where users can refine AI-suggested test suites or create tests from scratch with live browser previews.

## üîß Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration
Automate testing in CI/CD pipelines with natural language test suites that non-technical team members can create and maintain. Run multiple tests in parallel during deployment, with the AI handling browser navigation and verification steps, providing comprehensive test coverage without complex scripting.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing
Verify that your application works consistently across different browsers with identical natural language test cases. Run the same test instructions on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari simultaneously, leveraging parallel execution to dramatically reduce testing time while catching browser-specific inconsistencies.

### End-to-End Testing
Validate complete user journeys using natural language instructions - simply describe what you want to test in plain English. The AI autonomously navigates through complex flows like checkout processes or user registration, handling UI interactions and validations without needing to write selectors or code.

### Regression Testing
Maintain a library of human-readable test files that anyone on the team can understand and update. When code changes, the AI intelligently adapts to UI changes and new elements, reducing maintenance overhead while still reliably catching regressions in functionality.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Factifai Agent Suite follows a modular, pipeline-based architecture that transforms natural language test instructions into precise browser interactions:

### Key Components

- **Factifai Agent**: Orchestrates the end-to-end testing process
  - **LLM Orchestration Layer** (LangGraph): Manages the AI workflow for parsing instructions
  - **Node Pipeline**: Preprocessing ‚Üí Parsing ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Tracking ‚Üí Script Generation ‚Üí Reporting
  - **Configuration System**: Handles API keys and settings with persistent storage

- **Playwright Core**: Provides the browser automation foundation for factifai-agent
  - **Browser Service**: Manages browser sessions and page interactions
  - **Visual Element Detection**: Identifies clickable elements without requiring selectors
  - **Coordinate-Based Interaction**: Uses spatial positioning instead of DOM selectors

The architecture decouples natural language understanding from browser automation, allowing each component to evolve independently while maintaining compatibility. This also enables the tools to be used separately or together, depending on the specific testing needs.
