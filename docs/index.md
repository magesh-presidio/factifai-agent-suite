## Overview

The Factifai Agent Suite provides a collection of AI-powered tools designed to accelerate and enhance testing processes across various development workflows. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), the suite enables developers and QA teams to create, execute, and maintain tests using natural language, making testing more accessible, maintainable, and efficient.

Software testing has traditionally required specialized expertise and considerable time investment. The Factifai Agent Suite reimagines this process by allowing tests to be defined in plain English, automatically executed with precision, and seamlessly integrated into modern CI/CD pipelines.
